Branching Strategy and Feature Completion

phil/feature_name
darrell/feature_name

A feature is considered complete when:
	it has a working REST endpoint
	its service object code is covered by JUnit tests
	the JUnit tests use Mockito for any external objects
	the JUnit tests all pass
	
Once a feature is complete we'll do a code review and then merge with main
